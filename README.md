# Tyler
2d game engine written in python with pygame that emulates NES-style graphics, with only sprites and tiles being rendered, but with potential to render more if needed

## Usage
`dummy.py` shows a basic implementation of Tyler that renders a sprite that moves with a background

the only two built-in methods of rendering stuff is by tiles or sprites

tiles are rendered in a grid manner, and although technically can move, shouldn't move // potentially in the future can scroll

sprites are free to move anywhere

both have the same texture size on the screen
